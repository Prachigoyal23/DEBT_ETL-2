In the SQL_Queries file, I analysed the data
In this part I replace the mail id by example.co to gmail.com
After this I correct the phone number data
Add 2 more columns Income Level (IL) and Financial Status (FS)
and Generate a collection risk score for every borrower and rank borrowers based on this score

And In the Python code file I tried to write a code to visualize the data based on based on age, gender, marital status, language preference, loan type, credit score
